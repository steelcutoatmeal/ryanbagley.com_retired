## 

Hello and very pleased to have you here. I'm a network engineer and outdoor adventurer living in the American West. Namely, within the suburbs of Salt Lake City, Utah. I grew up in a few geographical areas of the United States but was fortunate enough to have parents that valued being outdoors and took the family on several camping trips each year. The impressions about being in nature certainly stayed with me and I have been trying to reintegrate that into my life as an adult. Much of the content I draft on this site is driven by my literary and visual appreciation of the American West. Hopefully by sharing these experiences I can fortify in others a respect for this unique geographic region.

The primary method of accessing these remote locations are with my off-road vehicle in an efficient and highly mobile fashion. In some circles this is called overlanding but to most it is just simply car camping. To be fair to the term, overlanding has a distinction of traversing rough and remote terrain whereas car camping is generally intended to only be through accessible roads and locations. The general goal of overlanding is to be self-sufficient in the backcountry and to experience the area while touring. While not experiencing nature as purely as a backpacker, I still strive for the same leave no trace philosophy and responsible land stewardship.

Other creative venues you might see me on are on my Instagram account, [tcp.rst](https://www.instagram.com/tcp.rst/). The name comes from the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is a network engineering methodology for computers to talk to each other and exchange information. If you have not heard of this term before you can trust that it guides the vast majority of communication over the internet. During a normal TCP conversation, certain flags can be added to packets for various reasons but the funniest is certainly the reset (RST) flag. If you can imagine having a normal conversation with another person and they suddenly scream "No!" and sprint out of the room without explanation. Many of my colleagues jokingly use the phrase “reset” when abruptly leaving a conversation at work. The kicker of this joke is that a RST packet is identified in red, which is the same color of my vehicle sporting this vanity license plate.
